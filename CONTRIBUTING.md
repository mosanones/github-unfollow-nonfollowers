### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Install development dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes thoroughly
5. Update documentation if needed
6. Submit the pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-unfollow-nonfollowers.git
cd github-unfollow-nonfollowers
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
```

4. Create your **.env** file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

## Style Guidelines

- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines.
- Use **descriptive variable names**.
- Add **docstrings** for functions and classes.
- Keep **functions focused and small**.

## Testing
Run tests before submitting
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

> **Note (personal):** I also run `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` locally to get cleaner tracebacks when debugging failures. Additionally, `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short -x` is handy to stop on the first failure and avoid scrolling through a wall of errors. For a quick coverage check, `python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short --cov=.` is useful too.

> **Note (personal):** When setting up the `.env` file, make sure the token has at least `read:user` and `user:follow` scopes — I kept running into silent auth failures until I double-checked this in the GitHub token settings.

> **Note (personal):** If you're on Windows and `source venv/bin/activate` doesn't work, use `venv\Scripts\activate` instead (no `source` prefix). Took me an embarrassingly long time to remember this the first time I set this up on a Windows machine.

**Thank you for contributing! 🚀**
